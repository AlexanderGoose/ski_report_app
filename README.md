# Ski Resort Conditions

Using open meteo api, this project gathers information from Colorado ski resorts and aims
to help users identify the best resort conditions. Using current snow, wind, temperature, and
visibility data it is possible to rank resorts. 

### Goals
<ul>
    <li>Noramlize Data</li>
    <li>Determine what are 'good' and 'bad' conditions</li>
    <li>Create a user interface in terminal</li>
    <li>Create a user interface in Swift</li>
</ul>

This project is inspired by my passion for weather and geolocation data.
